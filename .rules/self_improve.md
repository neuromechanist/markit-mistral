# Continuous Rule Improvement

## Improvement Triggers
- Pattern used 3+ times -> Create rule
- Common failures in .context/scratch_history.md -> Add prevention rule
- Successful .context/research.md solutions -> Standardize
- Repeated PR feedback -> Document standard

## Rule Updates

### Add Rules When:
- New pattern appears 3+ times
- Common bug could be prevented
- Better approach discovered

### Modify Rules When:
- Better examples found in codebase
- Edge cases discovered
- Implementation changed

### Remove Rules When:
- Tech stack changed
- Pattern deprecated
- No longer applicable

## Quality Checks
- **Actionable:** Clear what to do
- **Specific:** No ambiguity
- **Examples:** From actual code
- **Cross-referenced:** Link related rules

---
*Rules evolve from understanding. Document failures, standardize successes.*
